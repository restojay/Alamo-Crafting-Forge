## Marketing

### Etsy SEO (Primary Channel)

**Title formula:** `[Model] [Product] [Material] [Color] — Compatible with [Fitment]`

Example: *"Grip Plug for G19 Gen 5 — Nylon, Black — Fits Glock 19/19X/45"*

**Tags (use all 13):** Mix specific and broad:
- Specific: "G19 grip plug", "AR15 rail cover", "Glock accessory"
- Material: "nylon grip plug", "3D printed gun accessory"
- Use case: "concealed carry gear", "range accessories", "gun safe organizer"

**Category:** Sporting Goods > Hunting & Shooting > Gun Parts & Accessories

### Photography

- Photograph every part **installed on an actual firearm** — buyers need to see fitment
- Clean surface: black felt or wood table, natural light or one desk lamp
- Minimum 5 photos per listing: installed front, installed side, standalone, scale reference, lifestyle
- Form 4B resin parts photograph as "injection-molded quality" — use this as premium differentiator

### Community Presence (Free)

- **Reddit:** Post maker threads on r/Glocks, r/ar15, r/GunAccessoriesForSale showing print process
- **Gun forums:** Maker posts with behind-the-scenes content
- Don't hard-sell — build credibility through transparency. Link Etsy in profile bio.

### Paid (Month 2+ only)

- Etsy Ads: $1/day for first 30 days ($30 total) to seed impressions
- Kill ads on any listing with clicks but no sales after 14 days
- Don't scale ad spend until organic traction at 30+ units/month

## Growth Levers

- **Bundles** — increase AOV from $11 to $25+
- **Premium resin line** — Form 4B parts at 2x markup, injection-molded finish
- **Original CAD designs** — no licensing cost, can't be copied by competitors
- **Shopify DTC** — own the customer, capture margin lost to Etsy fees
- **Platform expansion** — Sig P365, CZ Scorpion, Ruger platforms after Glock/AR validation
- **Seasonal** — holiday gift sets, new gun model launches
- **Local gun shows** — cash sales, no fees, direct customer feedback

---

## Key Success Factors

1. **Fitment quality** — snap-fit tolerance is everything. A loose grip plug gets returned. Test on actual firearms before listing.
2. **Photography** — the single biggest conversion driver on Etsy. Installed shots on real firearms, not white-background product-only shots.
3. **Material differentiation** — Nylon and CF-PETG command premium over the $5.99 PLA sellers. Never compete on price with PLA prints.
4. **Speed to reviews** — first 20 reviews unlock Etsy search visibility. Prioritize volume early.
5. **Trademark discipline** — one Glock Inc. cease-and-desist can kill a shop. Always describe by fitment, never by brand.
6. **Original designs** — the long-term moat. Licensed STLs are a starting point, not a destination.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|-|-|-|
| Glock trademark C&D | High | Never use brand names — fitment descriptors only |
| Product liability claim | Medium | LLC + insurance + disclaimers + no functional parts |
| Etsy policy change on gun accessories | Medium | Shopify as backup channel, diversify early |
| Low sales volume | Medium | Validate with $200 before scaling investment |
| Competitor copies best-selling designs | Low | Commission original CAD designs for top sellers |
| Amazon listing suppression | Low | Don't rely on Amazon — Etsy + Shopify primary |
