## Margins

Formlabs Standard/Grey resin at $75/L.

### Small Mini Example ($12 sale)

| Item | Cost |
|-|-|
| Resin (~5-8mL) | $0.50 |
| Consumables (IPA, wear) | $0.30 |
| Packaging | $1.25 |
| Etsy fees | $1.00 |
| **Total cost** | **$3.05** |
| **Profit** | **$8.95 (75%)** |

### Large Monster Example ($35 sale)

| Item | Cost |
|-|-|
| Resin (~20-40mL) | $2.50 |
| Consumables | $0.40 |
| Packaging | $2.00 |
| Etsy fees | $2.50 |
| **Total cost** | **$7.40** |
| **Profit** | **$27.60 (79%)** |

Formlabs resin is 2-3x pricier than budget brands but the print quality commands premium pricing. The real margin killer is failed prints — dialing in supports and orientation early matters more than resin cost.

## Operations

### Print Workflow
- Batch prints — fill the build plate each run
- Build volume (218 x 128mm) fits ~8-15 small minis or 2-4 large pieces per plate
- 3-6 hours per plate, 3-4 plates/day at 30+ hrs/week
- Capacity: 24-60 small minis per day

### Post-Processing Pipeline
1. Wash (Form Wash or DIY IPA bath) — 10-20 min
2. Cure (Form Cure or DIY UV setup) — 30-60 min
3. Remove supports, light sanding of support marks
4. Quality check, bag, label
5. Batch everything — never post-process one at a time

### Inventory Strategy
- Start made-to-order to avoid dead stock
- Once top 10-15 sellers are identified, keep those in stock (Etsy rewards fast shipping in search)

## Startup Costs (~$685)

| Item | Cost |
|-|-|
| 2 STL subscriptions (3 months) | $160 |
| Resin stock (3-4 liters) | $300 |
| IPA, gloves, tools, sandpaper | $75 |
| Packaging (bags, boxes, labels) | $100 |
| Etsy shop setup + listing fees | $50 |

## Marketing

### Etsy SEO
- Front-load titles with search terms: "Dragon Miniature 28mm DnD Tabletop RPG Resin Printed"
- Use all 13 tags per listing — mix broad and specific
- Category: Toys & Games > Games & Puzzles > Role Playing Games > Miniatures
- First 3-5 listings define your shop's algorithmic identity — make them strong and consistent

### Getting First Reviews
- Price first 10-15 sales aggressively to get reviews fast
- Include thank-you card with review request
- Ship fast, package well — damaged minis kill early shops
- Offer a "starter set" bundle at a deal to drive volume

### Free Channels
- **Reddit** — r/PrintedMinis, r/DnD, r/minipainting. Engage first, sell second. Etsy in profile
- **Instagram/TikTok** — print peel videos, support removal, finished pieces
- **Facebook Groups** — DnD/Pathfinder/Warhammer groups with marketplace days

### Paid (Month 3+ only)
- Etsy Ads at $1-3/day, only on listings with organic traction
- Never advertise zero-sale listings

---

## Growth Levers

- **Bundles** — "Goblin Warband 6-pack" beats 6 individual listings
- **Seasonal drops** — Halloween undead, holiday gifts, tie to new D&D releases
- **Painted tier** — 3-5x markup on painted minis (add later or hire out)
- **Custom basing** — scenic bases add $3-5 per mini, low effort, high perceived value
- **Original designs** — as CAD skills develop, no licensing costs = pure margin
- **Platform expansion** — eBay, Shopify, local game store consignment
- **Second printer** — at month 6+ if demand exceeds single-printer throughput

## Key Success Factors

1. **Photography** — the single biggest conversion driver on Etsy. White background, good light, scale reference, phone camera is fine
2. **Support cleanup quality** — visible support scars are the #1 complaint in mini reviews
3. **Niche consistency** — don't scatter across random genres. Pick a lane (fantasy, sci-fi, etc.) and go deep
4. **Speed to reviews** — first 20 reviews unlock Etsy search visibility. Prioritize getting there fast
5. **Failed print rate** — keep it under 5% by investing time in learning optimal orientation and supports
